## Prioritization
### 1) Fetching and rendering list 
As per doing this exam i prioritize the development of fetching and showing the list of songs. Because, I found out that the provided REST API URL also fetches audiobooks and also this is the MVP of the exam as far as I know. Thus, I prioritized this feature over the other requirements

### 2) Sorting/Sectioned
As per developing this feature. I'm really not sure what is the meaning of this "Sectioned" feature. Thus, what I did is that I developed Tabs that can sort the song list by either Album or Release Date

### 3) Details
Instead of using navigation. I opted on using modals because I noticed that based on the requirements I just need to show 3 things : Artist name, Album name and Album art. So for me it is much easier to design the modal/popup UI because I can just put those things and not worry the rest of the screen that I was not able to design.

### 4) UI/UX
Unfortunately, I'm not that good in doing designs on the fly. But if you give me something to copy like sceens in figma then I can copy that using react-native. If we're talking about user experience like the flow of the app then I can put some inputs on that.


### Reasons of using Redux
On my previous project we are using MobX but I had a 2 weeks react training recently and we used Redux in that training. Thus, I just want to practice the skill that I acquired in my recent training. Actually, I was planning to use GraphQL because we also tackled the use of GraphQL in my recent training but I didn't have time to do that one.
